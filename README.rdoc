== Dibber

A set of tools to tidy up rails seeds.rb files.

Dibber has two compoments:

=== Seeder
Seeder is designed to simplify the process of pulling attributes from
YAML files, and populating ActiveRecord objects with those attributes.

=== ProcessLog
ProcessLog provides Seeder with a simple before and after reporting tool.

Have a look at the lib/examples folder, for a guide to how Dibber is used.
